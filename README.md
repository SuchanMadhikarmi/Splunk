<h1>Splunk Log Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I explored basic Splunk commands and analyzed DHCP, DNS, and HTTP logs. It was an introductory exercise in using Splunk for log management and analysis, highlighting its effectiveness in monitoring and troubleshooting network activities. 
<br />

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- <b>Splunk:</b>  Data-to-Everything platform for log management and analysis

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10(VM)</b>

<h2>Steps Undertaken:</h2>

These demonstrations represent a selection of the many queries I executed in Splunk for comprehensive log analysis and data exploration.

<p>
   1. <b>Setup Wazuh</b><br/>
     - Installed Splunk and set up a local instance.<br/>
     - Uploaded sample log files for DHCP, DNS, and HTTP data.<br/>
     - Verified successful data ingestion through the Splunk dashboard.<br/>
<br />
<br />
  2. <b>DHCP Log Analysis</b><br/>
     - Filtered DHCP logs to identify IP assignments and DHCP request patterns.<br/>

<br />
  
<h2>Outcomes:</h2>
     - Successfully analyzed DHCP, DNS, and HTTP logs using Splunk.<br/>
     - Learned how to use basic Splunk commands to extract meaningful insights from raw logs.<br/>
     - Gained hands-on experience with log management.<br/>
